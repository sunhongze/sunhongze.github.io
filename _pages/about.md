<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I graduated from the School of Artificial Intelligence (formerly the School of Electronic Engineering) at Xidian University in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Intelligent Science and Technology. I then pursued a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the School of Life Science and Technology at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). In my second year of the Master's program, I transitioned to a Ph.D. track under the supervision of Professor Daqing Guo. My research group, the Brain-Machine Interaction Lab, is affiliated with the Key Laboratory of Neuroinformatics of the Ministry of Education, the Sichuan Brain Science and Brain-Inspired Intelligence Research Institute, and the Clinical Hospital of the Chengdu Brain Science Research Institute. Our group focuses on research areas such as brain science and brain-inspired intelligence, brain data analysis, and large-scale whole-brain simulation, achieving a series of accomplishments in these fields. My primary research involves the application of brain-inspired intelligence in tasks related to computer vision, affective computing, and time-series signal analysis, with a specific focus on neuromorphic computing, spiking neural networks, and multimodal fusion. To date, I have published five academic papers (two as the first author) and applied for one patent. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RNa8D1sAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=引用"></a>

**My research area** ： Spiking neural networks; Brain-inspired intellgence; Computer vision; Intelligent application.
